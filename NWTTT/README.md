- The program is coded in Java, and I only used the default Java libraries, so
it should be able to run any machine with eclipse, or other java IDE/compiler.

1) Open Eclipse
2) File > Import > Existing Project into Workspace > Next > Archive file:
   > Browse > select the project file (zip file called NWTTT)
